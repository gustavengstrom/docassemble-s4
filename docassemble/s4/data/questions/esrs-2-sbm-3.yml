question: |
  Are all consumers and end-users who can be materially impacted by undertaking included in scope of disclosure under ESRS 2? 
help:
  label: Help?
  heading: <BR><h6>Explanation</h6>
  content: |
    AR 5.
    Impacts on consumers and/or end-users can originate in the undertaking’s business model or strategy in a number of different ways. For example, impacts may relate to the undertaking’s value proposition (for example, providing online platforms with potential for online and offline harm), its value chain (for example, speed in developing products or services, or delivering projects, with risks to health and safety), or its cost structure and the revenue model (for example, sales-maximising incentives that put consumers at risk).
    AR 6.
    Impacts on consumers and/or end-users that originate in the strategy or business model can also bring material risks to the undertaking. For example, if the undertaking’s business model is premised on incentivising its sales force to sell high volumes of a product or service (for example, credit cards or pain medicine) at speed, and this results in large- scale harm to consumers, the undertaking may face lawsuits and reputational damage affecting its future business and credibility.

    AR 8.
    With regard to paragraph 12, the risks could arise because of the undertaking’s dependency on consumers and/or end-users where low likelihood but high impact events may trigger financial effects, for example, where a global pandemic leads to severe impacts on certain consumers’ livelihoods resulting in major changes in patterns of consumption.
